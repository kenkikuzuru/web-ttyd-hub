## 📖 What is web-ttyd-hub?

web-ttyd-hub is a simple app that lets you open and control terminal sessions directly from your web browser. It uses well-known tools like ttyd and tmux to help you create and manage multiple shell sessions that stay active even if you close the browser. This means you can come back to your work anytime without losing progress.

You can use it to:

- Run command-line programs remotely.
- Switch easily between several terminal sessions.
- Access your sessions from any device with a browser.
- Keep your sessions running without interruption.

All this happens inside your browser window, so you don’t need to install or learn command-line tools to use it.

- **Hardware:** A device with at least 2 GB RAM and 1 GHz processor.
- **Network:** A stable internet or local network connection if you want to access sessions remotely.
